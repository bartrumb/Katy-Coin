# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Katy Coin is a conceptual project for a decentralized, AI-powered, community-driven economic system. The repository contains markdown documents outlining the vision, architecture, and implementation plans for this alternative economic system. The project is currently in a conceptual/planning phase.

### Core Concepts

- **Katy Coin (KC)**: A mutual credit system where currency is created at the point of trade, with 1 KC roughly equaling $1 USD at launch.
- **Three-Layer Architecture**:
  1. Market Intelligence: AI-powered system to determine the value of goods and services
  2. Barter Exchange: System for enabling peer-to-peer trades
  3. Katy Coin: System for tracking and balancing value over time
- **Edge-Based Computing**: Using Cloudflare Workers for real-time transactions
- **Blockchain Settlement**: Daily settlement batches on Polygon PoS for finality

### Repository Structure

This repository is primarily documentation-based with markdown files detailing different aspects of the Katy Coin vision:

- `KATY Coin the first thought.md`: Original concept document
- `Buddhist perspectives on Katy Coin's community-driven economics.md`: Analysis of Katy Coin through a Buddhist economic lens
- `Building from the Inside Out.md`: Detailed implementation approach
- `The Complete Vision and Implementation Plan.md`: Comprehensive overview of the system architecture
- `The Complete Economic Revolution Blueprint.md`: Broader economic vision and technical implementation details

## Technical Stack (Proposed)

While no actual code has been implemented yet, the proposed technical stack includes:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React Native
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers, D1 (SQL), Durable Objects
- **AI**: GPT-4, Claude, Workers AI
- **Blockchain**: Polygon PoS, Solidity

## Development Guide

As this project is in the conceptual phase, there are no build, test, or deployment procedures established yet. The next steps would involve:

1. Setting up a Cloudflare account for edge computing
2. Implementing the base architecture with Workers and D1
3. Creating a simple web interface with Next.js
4. Developing the initial mutual credit system
5. Integrating AI valuation capabilities

## Future Implementation

The repository outlines a phased implementation plan:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Core infrastructure setup
2. **Intelligence Phase**: AI orchestration implementation
3. **Community Systems**: Insurance and education components
4. **Scale Phase**: Network expansion and international bridges

This repository should be treated as a conceptual blueprint rather than an active software project at this time.
