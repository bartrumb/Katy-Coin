## üéØ Quick Start Guide

If you're new to Katy Coin, we recommend reading the documentation in this order:

1. **Start with "Why"**: Read [Why This Works](WHY-IT-WORKS.md) to understand the economic principles
2. **Understand the Solution**: Review [Capitalism Replacement](CAPITALISM-REPLACEMENT.md) to see what we're changing
3. **Explore the Tech**: Dive into [Technical Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md) for system design
4. **Bridge to Reality**: Learn about [Fiat Integration](FIAT-INTEGRATION.md) for practical implementation
5. **Follow the Journey**: Read through each phase to understand our roadmap

## üìã Document Standards

All documentation follows these conventions:
- **Emojis**: Used in H2 headers for visual navigation
- **Code Examples**: Provided in JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Cross-Links**: Heavy interlinking between related topics
- **Practical Focus**: Theory backed by implementation details
- **Table of Contents**: Always include a TOC for easy navigation
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Use Mermaid syntax for flowcharts and architecture diagrams If you see an ascii art diagram replace with a mermaid one, ensure the mermaid contains relevant emojis, and line descriptions for clarity
