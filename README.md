## 🌟 What is Katy Coin?

Imagine if you could trade your guitar lessons for fresh vegetables, your coding skills for childcare, or your spare bedroom for home repairs—all without needing cash. That's Katy Coin.

**The Big Idea**: Just like the historic "Katy" Railroad connected isolated communities in America, Katy Coin connects neighbors digitally so anyone can trade anything with anyone, building stronger communities where skills have real value.

- **People Helped** (not shareholders enriched)

## 🚂 The Katy Trail Connection

Just as the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad transformed America by connecting isolated communities, Katy Coin connects economic islands in the digital age. Starting in Saint Charles, Missouri—where the Katy Trail begins—we're laying new rails for economic freedom.

**From Rails to Blockchain. From Isolation to Connection. From Scarcity to Abundance.**
